2048 for the Casio calculator language.

This language doesn't allow comments... (AFAIK)

I have used * where the multiply symbol is used in the real language

Disclaimer: I have copy-typed this from my calculator, so I may have made mistakes or omitted/added parts and forgotten to update the other.

TODO:
 - Remove debug printing
 - Quit other than by AC/ON? 
 - Detecting lose (probably won't bother)
 - Add indents?
 - Bug: when combining, the next piece may not shuffle up? (only left/right?) Why?
	- Fixed I think
 - Bug: left/right don't seem to work for "shuffle" moves?
	- Fixed I think
